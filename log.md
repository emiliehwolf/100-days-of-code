# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0.0: May 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Created #100DaysOfCode Challenge in my Data Scientists party on Habitica. We officially begin on Monday, May 15th. Logged into Kaggle.com and HackerRank.com to get an overview of the lessons and competitions. Also browsed FreeCodeCamp.com/map

**Thoughts:** Kaggle seems the most specialized for data science, but I still need to learn more R Programming before I'm ready for Kaggle. I think I will use my library book, R in 24 Hours, and my Coursera lessons as my curriculum. I will also continue to study R vocabulary on Memrise to keep things interesting and avoid monotony.

### Day 0.1: May 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Listened to "Not So Standard Deviations" podcast while copying down common R functions from Memrise. New Habitica party member Daralysis joined today, so I saved the last 7 days of chat log in a Google doc so I won't forget all their names and introductions. Finally, completed several SWIRL lessons for Coursera and perused the first graphics chapter in my book, R in 24 Hours.

**Thoughts:** The Swirl lesson "Working with Colors" introduced me to several new functions: colorRamp(), colorRampPallete(), rgb(), and brewer.pal() from the RColorBrewer package. colorRampPallete() takes 2 colors and integer n and the result is a vector of colors of length n that are between the min and max you specified. This will be extremely helpful when I need to make a range of 366 colors for the publication of my dream journal. I remember I used Google Spreadsheet to come up with these colors and it took a long time. Now I know a much faster way to get these colors if I decide to change the ranges or the opacity!

### Day 1: May 15, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Today I entered in much of the practice code from Chapter 14 of my library book (R in 24 Hours). I saved all the plots and the Rhistory and uploaded them to GitHub using SourceTree. I ended up working for 1.5 hours. 

**Thoughts:** Next I'll make a nice markdown file in the repo and display the plots so I'll have a quick reference guide.

### Day 2: May 16, 2017, Tuesday, 3:30AM

**Today's Progress**: Created markdown file to display ggplot2 quick plot examples from my library book, R in 24 Hours.

**Thoughts**: Not sure if this counts for the next day since I haven't slept yet. Oh well. I think my markdown file looks very nice and can probably be transformed into HTML pretty easily. I can't wait to finish the chapter in my book with all the ggplot() examples
