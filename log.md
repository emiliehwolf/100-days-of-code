# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0.0: May 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Created #100DaysOfCode Challenge in my Data Scientists party on Habitica. We officially begin on Monday, May 15th. Logged into Kaggle.com and HackerRank.com to get an overview of the lessons and competitions. Also browsed FreeCodeCamp.com/map

**Thoughts:** Kaggle seems the most specialized for data science, but I still need to learn more R Programming before I'm ready for Kaggle. I think I will use my library book, R in 24 Hours, and my Coursera lessons as my curriculum. I will also continue to study R vocabulary on Memrise to keep things interesting and avoid monotony.

### Day 0.1: May 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Listened to "Not So Standard Deviations" podcast while copying down common R functions from Memrise. New Habitica party member Daralysis joined today, so I saved the last 7 days of chat log in a Google doc so I won't forget all their names and introductions. Finally, completed several SWIRL lessons for Coursera and perused the first graphics chapter in my book, R in 24 Hours.

**Thoughts:** The Swirl lesson "Working with Colors" introduced me to several new functions: colorRamp(), colorRampPallete(), rgb(), and brewer.pal() from the RColorBrewer package. colorRampPallete() takes 2 colors and integer n and the result is a vector of colors of length n that are between the min and max you specified. This will be extremely helpful when I need to make a range of 366 colors for the publication of my dream journal. I remember I used Google Spreadsheet to come up with these colors and it took a long time. Now I know a much faster way to get these colors if I decide to change the ranges or the opacity!

### Day 1: May 15, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Today I entered in much of the practice code from Chapter 14 of my library book (R in 24 Hours). I saved all the plots and the Rhistory and uploaded them to GitHub using SourceTree. I ended up working for 1.5 hours. 

**Thoughts:** Next I'll make a nice markdown file in the repo and display the plots so I'll have a quick reference guide.

### Day 2: May 16, 2017, Tuesday, 3:30AM

**Today's Progress:** Created markdown file to display ggplot2 quick plot examples from my library book, R in 24 Hours.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if this counts for the next day since I haven't slept yet. Oh well. I think my markdown file looks very nice and can probably be transformed into HTML pretty easily. I can't wait to finish the chapter in my book with all the ggplot() examples

### Day 3: May 17, 2017, Wednesday, 5:00AM

**Today's Progress:** Finished creating my study guide from chapter 14 of my library book, R in 24 Hours.

**Thoughts:** Can't stop, won't stop. Was surprised to find out pie charts are discouraged in R. Eager to do the Quiz and Activities section for this chapter tomorrow.

### Day 4: May 18, 2017, Thursday, 11:57PM

**Today's Progress:** Added the 6 Activities to the study guide on my GitHub! Now watching the lecture videos for this week's Coursera.

**Thoughts:** I learned how to use the randomcoloR library to make unique color palettes.

### Day 5: May 19, 2017, Friday, 4:08PM

Today I worked through the 3 lecture videos on Clustering from Exploratory Data Analysis and practiced entering all the code from the tutorial. I basically got the same plots and results from this [study guide here](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis/hierarchicalClustering/index.md). 
Tonight and this weekend I need to finish the rest of Week 3 videos and Swirl practice exercises so I will be ready for the difficult assignment for week 4. All these statistical techniques are useful to know and I shouldn't stress so much about comprehending them fully, but rather just be familiar with them so I know where to get the answers should the question arise.

### Day 6: May 21, 2017, Sunday, 2:36AM

Plodding away on the remaining lecture videos and SWIRL practice assignments for Week 3 of Exploratory Data Analysis. Wish I could have gotten more done the last few days, but my personal life was more important. Will stay on track!

### Day 7, May 22, 2017, Monday, 3:25AM

Finished the SWIRL tutorials on Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means Clustering, Dimension Reduction, and a real-world clustering example. [Here's a link to the tutorial on GitHub.](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis/clusteringExample/index.md)

### Day 8, May 25, 2017, Thursday, 1:08AM

**Today's Progress:** Today I looked through my library book, R in 24 Hours, for any reference to clustering, kmeans, imputing, or dimension reduction. No such luck. Next I went for a walk to the grocery store and listened to [Not So Standard Deviations Episode 11](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast/episode-11-start-and-stop) along the way and back. Once I came home, I worked on a business article for LinkedIn and got swept away editing. Finally I realized I was over-editing and decided to not work on it again until I had slept. Now I'm lying in bed watching the [Air Pollution Case Study video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/lecture/hVteM/air-pollution-case-study) and following along the [R script analysis](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis/CaseStudy/script.R).

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed the podcast today as I walked. It was a gorgeous day with lots of sun and the podcast was about Roger and Hilary's answer to the question, What's the first thing you do for a data analysis? Hilary starts by tidying the data and then applies it to the "Hadley-verse" (Hadley Wickam is the author of many specialized R packages). Roger starts by wrangling missing data (NA's) and then usually goes straight into modeling (regression?). They discussed whether or not they prefer boxplots or overlaying histograms when doing basic exploratory plots.

### Day 9, May 25, 2017, Thursday, 11:02PM

**Today's Progress:** I finished going through the Air Pollution Case Study from yesterday and I uploaded the analysis script with tons and tons of comments so I can always look back and understand it.

**Thoughts:** Lazy day for me. I'm curious and want to keep learning.

# Day 10, May 27, 2017, Saturday, 1:19AM

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on the final assignment for the Exploratory Data Analysis class. We are supposed to analyze the PM2.5 Emissions data from NEI and create plots that show whether or not emissions have decreased based on different criteria. I finished the first 3 plots (and in fact, I did the 3rd plot 3 different ways).

**Thoughts:** I like tackling these questions by first drawing on paper the kind of graphs and data tables I expect to have. Then I play around in R to manipulate the data and plot it. I still find myself forgetting function names and arguments, but as long as I have a rough idea of what steps to take, I can usually find the code on StackOverflow.

### Day 11, Saturday, May 27, 2017, 7:00PM
All I did today was go for an hour walk and listen to episodes 13 and 14 of the Not So Standard Deviations podcast
